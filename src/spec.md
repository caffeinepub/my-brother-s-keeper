# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Allow users to request admin access directly from the Profile page and immediately gain access without re-logging in.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a "Request Admin Access" button to the Profile page for non-admin users
- Display loading state while the request is being processed
- Show success/error toasts after the request completes
- Automatically refresh the user's role after successful admin access request

**User-visible outcome:** Users can request admin access from their Profile page and immediately access admin features upon approval without needing to log out and back in.
