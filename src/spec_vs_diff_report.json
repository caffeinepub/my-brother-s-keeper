  "summary": "The diff adds a localStorage-backed zoom preference, a shared Google Maps URL builder, and updates LastKnownLocationCard to include a zoom parameter. MeetupPage shows imports for the zoom control and URL/preference utilities, but the truncated diff does not provide evidence that the control is rendered in the required panel or that MeetupPage map links are actually generated with the preferred zoom.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "A zoom control is available in the UI where map links are shown (at minimum on the Meetup location result panel).",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks to persist and reuse a preferred zoom with a sensible default; it does not request a clear/reset function or explicit range/default accessors (though they may be reasonable internal additions).",
