  "summary": "The implementation partially addresses the BuildRequest but has critical gaps. REQ-1 requires a 'Request Admin Access' button on the Profile page, but the diff shows the button was only added to AccessDeniedScreen.tsx (admin route guard), not ProfilePage.tsx as specified. REQ-2 appears fully implemented with role refetching after successful requests.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Display a 'Request Admin Access' button prominently on the Profile page for users who do not have admin privileges. The button should be visible below the user's profile information.",
      "reason": "The diff shows ProfilePage.tsx was modified to import useRequestAdminAccess and useGetCallerUserRole hooks, and includes handleRequestAdminAccess function logic, but the actual button implementation in the ProfilePage component is truncated in the diff. The button was definitively added to AccessDeniedScreen.tsx instead, which violates the explicit requirement to place it on the Profile page.",

      "description": "Added 'Request Admin Access' button to AccessDeniedScreen.tsx (admin access denied page)",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states in non-goals: 'Adding admin access requests to pages other than Profile'. The button was added to the access denied screen shown when non-admin users try to access admin routes, which was not requested and violates the stated non-goals.",
