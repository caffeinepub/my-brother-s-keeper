  "summary": "Implemented a new client-side QR generation pipeline (custom ISO/IEC-18004-style generator + mount-aware React hook) and integrated it into both ShareDialog and FlyerPage, with loading/error states and fallback messaging. However, the diff evidence focuses on generation failures/timeouts and does not clearly show user-facing guidance for the case where a QR code renders but is still not scannable.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-40",
      "requirement": "Add clear, English, user-facing error handling and recovery guidance specifically for the case where a QR code is rendered but cannot be scanned, including an obvious fallback path to share via the displayed App Link (copy/share) without implying the user’s phone is at fault.",
      "reason": "The changes add error handling for QR generation failure/timeout (toast + overlay), but there is no clear evidence of guidance for the scenario where the QR code successfully renders yet a user still can’t scan it (e.g., a persistent ‘Having trouble scanning?’ helper with explicit Copy Link/App Link fallback).",
