  "summary": "Admin Dashboard page, admin nav label, and backend admin-gated registrations API were added. However, the backend registrations retrieval does not show deterministic ordering, and the Flyer page clarification copy cannot be confirmed from the provided truncated diff. Some additional Flyer auto-export/query-param behavior appears added beyond the request.",

      "requirement": "The admin-only backend method for retrieving registrations must return stable, deterministic data for a given state (e.g., consistent ordering such as by name or principal).",
      "reason": "The new admin-gated method returns `userProfiles.toArray()` with no explicit sorting, so ordering may be non-deterministic.",
