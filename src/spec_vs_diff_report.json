  "summary": "The diff clearly removes QR-related UI from the flyer preview and updates flyer export to generate a PNG without relying on a QR canvas, including preserving auto-export behavior. The Share dialog description is updated to link-sharing language, but the diff snippet is truncated before showing whether QR rendering/hook usage and the “Download QR” action were actually removed/disabled, so REQ-1 cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove QR canvas rendering and QR generation hook usage from the Share dialog; remove/disable the “Download QR” action; ensure no QR generating/error overlay states appear.",
      "reason": "ShareDialog.tsx is truncated before the relevant UI/actions area; the shown portion does not include any QR canvas, QR hook usage, or a “Download QR” button, but the truncation prevents confirming they were removed rather than existing further down the file.",
